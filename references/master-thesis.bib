                   classical decoding system interfacing with quantum hardware
                   to perform quantum error correction. It is important that
                   the decoder can keep pace with the quantum clock speed,
                   within the limitations on communication that are imposed by
                   the physical architecture. To this end we propose a local
                   `pre-decoder', which makes greedy corrections to reduce the
                   amount of syndrome data sent to a standard matching decoder.
                   We study these classical overheads for the surface code
                   under a phenomenological phase-flip noise model with
                   imperfect measurements. We find substantial improvements in
                   the runtime of the global decoder and the communication
                   bandwidth by using the pre-decoder. For instance, to achieve
                   a logical failure probability of $f = 10^\{-15\}$ using
                   qubits with physical error rate $p = 10^\{-3\}$ and a
                   distance $d=22$ code, we find that the bandwidth cost is
                   reduced by a factor of $1000$, and the time taken by a
                   matching decoder is sped up by a factor of $200$. To achieve
                   this target failure probability, the pre-decoding approach
                   requires a $50\%$ increase in the qubit count compared with
                   the optimal decoder.",

                   and subsystem codes subject to Pauli noise. For a code

                   $O(n\log n+n\chi^3)$, where $\chi$ is an approximation

               qubits are arranged in a two-dimensional array on a surface of
               nontrivial topology, and encoded quantum operations are
               associated with nontrivial homology cycles of the surface. We
               formulate protocols for error recovery, and study the efficacy
               of these protocols. An order-disorder phase transition occurs in
               this system at a nonzero critical value of the error rate; if
               the error rate is below the critical value (the accuracy
               threshold), encoded information can be protected arbitrarily
               well in the limit of a large code block. This phase transition
               can be accurately modeled by a three-dimensional Z2 lattice

                   implementation uses a reduction from MLD to simulation of

  abstract  = "Recent progress in studies of holographic dualities, originally
               motivated by insights from string theory, has led to a
               confluence with concepts and techniques from quantum information
               theory. A particularly successful approach has involved
               capturing holographic properties by means of tensor networks
               which not only give rise to physically meaningful correlations
               of holographic boundary states, but also reproduce and refine
               features of quantum error correction in holography. This topical
               review provides an overview over recent successful realizations
               of such models. It does so by building on an introduction of the
               theoretical foundations of AdS/CFT and necessary quantum
               information concepts, many of which have themselves developed
               into independent, rapidly evolving research fields.",

                   are well below what is achievable with physical qubits.
                   Quantum error correction offers a path to
                   algorithmically-relevant error rates by encoding logical
                   qubits within many physical qubits, where increasing the
                   number of physical qubits enhances protection against
                   physical errors. However, introducing more qubits also
                   increases the number of error sources, so the density of
                   errors must be sufficiently low in order for logical
                   performance to improve with increasing code size. Here, we
                   report the measurement of logical qubit performance scaling
                   across multiple code sizes, and demonstrate that our system
                   of superconducting qubits has sufficient performance to
                   overcome the additional errors from increasing qubit number.
                   We find our distance-5 surface code logical qubit modestly
                   outperforms an ensemble of distance-3 logical qubits on
                   average, both in terms of logical error probability over 25
                   cycles and logical error per cycle ($2.914\%\pm 0.016\%$
                   compared to $3.028\%\pm 0.023\%$). To investigate damaging,
                   low-probability error sources, we run a distance-25
                   repetition code and observe a $1.7\times10^\{-6\}$ logical
                   error per round floor set by a single high-energy event
                   ($1.6\times10^\{-7\}$ when excluding this event). We are
                   able to accurately model our experiment, and from this model
                   we can extract error budgets that highlight the biggest
                   challenges for future systems. These results mark the first
                   experimental demonstration where quantum error correction
                   begins to improve performance with increasing qubit number,
                   illuminating the path to reaching the logical error rates

                   quantum-computing architecture. In this perspective we
                   explore decoding algorithms for the surface code; a
                   prototypical quantum low-density parity-check code that
                   underlies many of the leading efforts to demonstrate
                   scalable quantum computing. Central to our discussion is the
                   minimum-weight perfect-matching decoder. The decoder works
                   by exploiting underlying structure that arises due to
                   materialised symmetries among surface-code stabilizer
                   elements. By concentrating on these symmetries, we begin to
                   address the question of how a minimum-weight
                   perfect-matching decoder might be generalised for other
                   types of code. We approach this question first by
                   investigating examples of matching decoders for other codes.
                   These include decoding algorithms that have been specialised
                   to correct for noise models that demonstrate a particular
                   structure or bias with respect to certain types of code. In

                   constructing a minimum-weight perfect-matching decoder for
                   codes with certain characteristic properties. The properties
                   we make use of are common among topological codes. We
                   discuss the broader applicability of the proposal, and we

                   these requirements. We then introduce the construction of
                   local neural network (NN) decoders using three-dimensional
                   convolutions. These local decoders are adapted to
                   circuit-level noise and can be applied to surface code
                   volumes of arbitrary size. Their application removes errors
                   arising from a certain number of faults, which serves to
                   substantially reduce the syndrome density. Remaining errors
                   can then be corrected by a global decoder, such as Blossom
                   or Union Find, with their implementation significantly
                   accelerated due to the reduced syndrome density. However, in
                   the circuit-level setting, the corrections applied by the
                   local decoder introduce many vertical pairs of highlighted
                   vertices. To obtain a low syndrome density in the presence
                   of vertical pairs, we consider a strategy of performing a
                   syndrome collapse which removes many vertical pairs and
                   reduces the size of the decoding graph used by the global
                   decoder. We also consider a strategy of performing a
                   vertical cleanup, which consists of removing all local
                   vertical pairs prior to implementing the global decoder.
                   Lastly, we estimate the cost of implementing our local
                   decoders on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs).",
