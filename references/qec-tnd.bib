  abstract      = "In this work we develop a general tensor network decoder for
                   2D codes. Specifically, we propose a decoder that
                   approximates maximally likelihood decoding for 2D stabiliser
                   and subsystem codes subject to Pauli noise. For a code
                   consisting of $n$ qubits our decoder has a runtime of
                   $O(n\log n+n\chi^3)$, where $\chi$ is an approximation
                   parameter. We numerically demonstrate the power of this
                   decoder by studying four classes of codes under three noise
                   models, namely regular surface codes, irregular surface
                   codes, subsystem surface codes and colour codes, under
                   bit-flip, phase-flip and depolarising noise. We show that
                   the thresholds yielded by our decoder are state-of-the-art,
                   and numerically consistent with optimal thresholds where
                   available, suggesting that the tensor network decoder well
                   approximates optimal decoding in all these cases. Novel to
                   our decoder is an efficient and effective approximate
                   contraction scheme for arbitrary 2D tensor networks, which
                   may be of independent interest. We have also released an

  abstract  = "We analyze surface codes, the topological quantum
               error-correcting codes introduced by Kitaev. In these codes,
               qubits are arranged in a two-dimensional array on a surface of
               nontrivial topology, and encoded quantum operations are
               associated with nontrivial homology cycles of the surface. We
               formulate protocols for error recovery, and study the efficacy
               of these protocols. An order-disorder phase transition occurs in
               this system at a nonzero critical value of the error rate; if
               the error rate is below the critical value (the accuracy
               threshold), encoded information can be protected arbitrarily
               well in the limit of a large code block. This phase transition
               can be accurately modeled by a three-dimensional Z2 lattice
               gauge theory with quenched disorder. We estimate the accuracy
               threshold, assuming that all quantum gates are local, that
               qubits can be measured rapidly, and that polynomial-size
               classical computations can be executed instantaneously. We also
               devise a robust recovery procedure that does not require
               measurement or fast classical processing; however, for this
               procedure the quantum gates are local only if the qubits are
               arranged in four or more spatial dimensions. We discuss
               procedures for encoding, measurement, and performing
               fault-tolerant universal quantum computation with surface codes,

                   stabilizer circuits. The paper explains how Stim works and
                   compares it to existing tools. With no foreknowledge, Stim
                   can analyze a distance 100 surface code circuit (20 thousand
                   qubits, 8 million gates, 1 million measurements) in 15
                   seconds and then begin sampling full circuit shots at a rate
                   of 1 kHz. Stim uses a stabilizer tableau representation,
                   similar to Aaronson and Gottesman's CHP simulator, but with
                   three main improvements. First, Stim improves the asymptotic
                   complexity of deterministic measurement from quadratic to
                   linear by tracking the \{\textbackslashem inverse\} of the
                   circuit's stabilizer tableau. Second, Stim improves the
                   constant factors of the algorithm by using a cache-friendly
                   data layout and 256 bit wide SIMD instructions. Third, Stim
                   only uses expensive stabilizer tableau simulation to create
                   an initial reference sample. Further samples are collected

                   due to Dennis, Kitaev, Landahl and Preskill, from quantum
                   error correcting codes to statistical mechanical models. We
                   show how the mapping can be extended to arbitrary stabiliser
                   or subsystem codes subject to correlated Pauli noise models,
                   including models of fault tolerance. This mapping connects
                   the error correction threshold of the quantum code to a
                   phase transition in the statistical mechanical model. Thus,
                   any existing method for finding phase transitions, such as
                   Monte Carlo simulations, can be applied to approximate the
                   threshold of any such code, without having to perform
                   optimal decoding. By way of example, we numerically study
                   the threshold of the surface code under mildly correlated
                   bit-flip noise, showing that noise with bunching
                   correlations causes the threshold to drop to
                   $p_\{\textrm\{corr\}\}=10.04(6)\%$, from its known iid value
                   of $p_\{\text\{iid\}\}=10.917(3)\%$. Complementing this, we
                   show that the mapping also allows us to utilise any
                   algorithm which can calculate/approximate partition
                   functions of classical statistical mechanical models to
                   perform optimal/approximately optimal decoding.

                   (MLD) for the 2D surface code with a noiseless syndrome

                   time $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the number of code qubits. Our
                   implementation uses a reduction from MLD to simulation of
                   matchgate quantum circuits. This reduction however requires
                   a special noise model with independent bit-flip and
                   phase-flip errors. Secondly, we show how to implement MLD
                   approximately for more general noise models using matrix
                   product states (MPS). Our implementation has running time

                   The subroutine uses MPS with a bond dimension $\chi$ to
                   approximate the sequence of tensors arising in the course of
                   contraction. We benchmark the MPS-based decoder against the
